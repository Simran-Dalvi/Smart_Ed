# Problem Solving in AI

Problem solving is a fundamental aspect of Artificial Intelligence (AI), where the goal is to develop intelligent agents that can analyze situations and derive solutions in a structured and efficient manner. The problem-solving process is typically broken down into several key stages to ensure clarity, efficiency, and effectiveness.



## Problem Solving Design

1. **Define the Problem**  
   Clearly specify the problem by identifying the initial state, goal state, and constraints. This includes formalizing the problem in terms of inputs, outputs, and desired outcomes.
2. **Analyze the Problem**  
   Understand the nature and scope of the problem. This involves evaluating complexity, identifying potential sub-problems, and determining if the problem is solvable using existing AI techniques.
3. **Identification of Solution**  
   Explore possible solution methods, such as algorithms, heuristics, or models. This phase involves selecting approaches based on how well they fit the structure of the problem.
4. **Choosing the Solution**  
   Evaluate the identified solutions based on performance criteria such as efficiency, feasibility, and scalability, then select the most suitable one.
5. **Implementation**  
   Translate the chosen solution into a working model or algorithm. This may include writing code, testing with sample data, and refining the logic based on outcomes.



## Properties of Search Algorithms

When evaluating search algorithms in AI, the following four properties are crucial:

1. **Completeness**  
   Indicates whether the algorithm is guaranteed to find a solution if one exists.
2. **Optimality**  
   Refers to whether the algorithm finds the best solution, typically the one with the lowest cost.
3. **Time Complexity**  
   Measures the amount of time the algorithm takes in the worst-case scenario, usually in terms of number of nodes explored.
4. **Space Complexity**  
   Refers to the amount of memory the algorithm consumes during execution.



## Types of Search Algorithms

Search algorithms are used to traverse the state space in order to find a path from the initial state to the goal state. They are classified into two main types:

### 1\. Uninformed Search (Blind Search)

These algorithms have no additional information about the goal's location beyond the definition of the problem.  
**Examples**:

* Breadth-First Search (BFS)
* Depth-First Search (DFS)
* Uniform Cost Search

### 2\. Informed Search (Heuristic Search)

These algorithms use domain-specific knowledge or heuristics to guide the search toward the goal more efficiently.  
**Examples**:

* A\* Search
* Greedy Best-First Search
