The **No Free Lunch Theorem (NFLT)** is a fundamental concept in machine learning and optimization, stating that:

> **No single algorithm performs best for all possible problems.**

In other words, if an algorithm performs well on one type of problem, it will perform worse on another, when performance is averaged over all possible problems.
